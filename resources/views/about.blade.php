            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! ðŸ‘‹, first of all I want to thank you for looking at my portfolio. I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. My name is Muhammad Zulhusni Bin Rosdan, a 20-year-old final year student at Kolej Professional Mara Beranang, Selangor. I'm pursuing a Diploma in Computer Science from 2021 to 2024 and currently doing an internship at Assra Digital Sdn Bhd. Originally from Kota Bharu, Kelantan, I'm passionate about technology and excited to showcase my journey in the world of software development!<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not coding, you can often find me outdoors capturing breathtaking moments with my drone. I have a keen interest in videography and love to create stunning aerial footage that I share with the world on social media platforms. It's not just a hobby; it's a creative outlet that allows me to combine my love for technology and storytelling into captivating videos that inspire and entertain others.
                Also, in terms of sports I prefer playing Futsal but depending on the situation if I have the right time I will go play futsal with my friends.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2015 to 2020, I dedicated my academic journey to SMK Pengkalan Chepa 2, located in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. During this time, I laid the foundations of my educational path, honing important skills and cultivating a passion for learning that will carry me forward.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to higher education, from 2021 to 2024, I am pursuing a Computer Science Diploma at MARA Beranang Professional College in Selangor. Throughout my diploma, I was actively involved in various academic and extracurricular activities, participating in the Python challenge competition in February 2023. Three of my friends including me were teammates and in the competition we managed to become the champion which showcased our proficiency in Python programming. Furthermore, my academic performance has been consistently excellent, achieving a GPA of 3.64 in the first semester of March 2022, followed by significant achievements in subsequent semesters. 
                Currently, I am embarking on an enriching internship journey at Assra Digital Sdn Bhd, where I intend to further enhance my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. Among my plans after the diploma is to pursue a degree in the field of information technology

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned on the homepage. I mainly work with Python, PHP, and JavaScript for making the back-end part of websites. I use frameworks like Laravel and Django to help speed up my work. For the parts of user interface, I use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React to make them look nice and easy to use. I also know how to use Git to keep track of changes in my code, and I use MySQL to store and organize data for websites/system. <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm always trying to learn new things and get better at what I do. Even though I've recently started learning frameworks like Laravel and React, I make sure to spend some time every day practicing and trying out new ideas. This helps me keep up with the latest trends and technology in the field of software development. By staying curious and open to learning, I'm always making new projects and solving problems creatively.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my computer science diploma and in my free time, I've worked on various projects, including a stock management system, homestay booking system, weather app, task-list application, and book review platform. These projects have allowed me to apply what I've learned in a practical setting and gain valuable hands-on experience in software development. <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completing each project, I make sure to deploy it to ensure that it's accessible and usable by others. This deployment process helps me understand the real-world implications of my work and allows me to receive feedback from users, which I use to improve my projects further. <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm committed to continually enhancing my programming skills, and one way I do this is by undertaking new projects whenever time permits. By working on diverse projects, I not only expand my knowledge but also strengthen my problem-solving abilities and creativity in software development.
